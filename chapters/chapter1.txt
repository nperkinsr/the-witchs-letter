Chapter One: The Letter

Once upon a time, in a village haunted by secrets, the fog never quite lifted.

Even on the sunniest mornings, it clung to the cobblestones like something alive, curling into window cracks and seeping into teacups left unattended. The villagers of Blackwood Hollow had long stopped commenting on the strange mist — they had other things to worry about. Things like unexplained dreams, vanished livestock, and the occasional echo of a woman’s laughter in the woods.

It had been sixty years since the burning, though no one spoke of it aloud. Not in the inn. Not in the church. Not even in the privacy of their homes, where the walls seemed to lean in just a little too close when secrets were whispered.

Mara Whitlow didn’t believe in curses.

She believed in ink, in records, in things that could be filed and stamped and neatly placed into wooden drawers. As the village scribe, she had made it her business to unearth the truth beneath folklore — to separate the facts from the convenient fiction. So when she was tasked with cataloguing the old parish records stored in the chapel’s mouldy basement, she grumbled only a little and brought three candles, two quills, and one very stale biscuit.

The basement groaned as she stepped inside, the heavy wooden door sighing shut behind her. Dust tickled her nose. Shelves leaned like drunkards. The only light came from her candles, casting flickering shadows on the walls — one of which looked eerily like a hunched woman.

“I don’t have time for ghosts today,” Mara muttered, setting down her satchel.

Hours passed as she worked, flipping through brittle pages, recording births and deaths, tracing the fading ink of ancient marriages. It was dull work, but safe. Predictable. That is, until her hand brushed the back of a cabinet, and felt something that didn’t belong.

A tiny curl of wax.

She blinked and reached into the shadows, fingers brushing against parchment — thick and crinkled, sealed with black wax in the shape of a crescent moon. The air shifted, colder suddenly. Mara held her breath.

The letter wasn’t listed in any of the indexes. It had no date. No name. Just a warning, scrawled on the outside in the same jagged hand that had cursed the town’s memory:

“This is not for you.”

Mara stared at it. She knew, in that way all people know when they’re about to make a Very Bad Decision, that opening it would be foolish. Dangerous. Maybe even fatal.

But curiosity is a sharp, unkind thing.

And Mara, despite all her logic, all her training, was still a child of Blackwood Hollow.

She peeled the wax seal off with a trembling hand — and the candle flames went out.

That night, Mara dreamed of black trees and red thread. But it wasn't just a dream. It was a place — too vivid to be imagined, too wrong to be real.

She stood barefoot on cold earth, under a sky that shimmered like oil on water. The trees loomed tall and thin, their bark bleeding sap that glowed faintly red. The branches moved even though there was no wind, creaking in rhythm with something deeper. Something breathing.

The ground was soft, too soft — like walking on forgotten graves. Thread crisscrossed between the trunks, red as veins, pulsing faintly. Some of it was tangled around her wrists, though she hadn’t noticed it until she tried to move.

A lullaby echoed through the trees. Slow, wrong. Sung in a voice that rasped like someone trying to remember how to breathe.

At the centre of the grove stood a child. He was barefoot, his back turned, his grey skin stretched tight like paper that had been burned and smoothed out again. His hair hung in stringy tufts, and his arms dangled too long by his sides.

Mara’s voice cracked when she spoke. “Are you lost?”

The child twitched. Slowly, he turned — not his body, just his head, in a way no neck should allow. One eye, impossibly large, glistened with a blackness that seemed to go on forever.

His mouth was a torn line. When he smiled, it opened wider than it should have.

“Found you,” he whispered. The lullaby stopped.

Mara’s feet were suddenly bound by the red thread, pulling tighter, slicing skin.

From the trees, dozens of eyes opened, blinking sideways. Watching.

Mara woke up screaming, tangled in her sheets, her skin cold and damp with sweat. The red mark on her wrist from the dream — it was still there.

She burned the letter the next morning.

Or tried to.

The parchment blackened but didn’t curl. Instead, the flames receded, almost afraid. Then the ink began to move — bleeding out of the words, curling into shapes across the page. It spelled her name.

She dropped it.

The mark on her shoulder — just a tiny smudge the night before — was now a full word. A word she didn’t recognise.

By midday, the birds had stopped singing.

By nightfall, her cat was gone.

And outside her window, something small and pale stood watching.

Humming.
