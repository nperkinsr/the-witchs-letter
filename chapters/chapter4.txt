The woods were not silent anymore.

As Mara stepped into the forest heart, the trees bent toward her, whispering in voices that did not belong to the living. The sky churned, clouds boiling as the last remnants of the village’s protection crumbled.

She carried the letter in her hand, now blackened and brittle but pulsing with heat. The mark on her shoulder had spread across her back, veins like thorny roots reaching toward her heart.

Rowan followed behind, clutching the book that held the Ashthorn Rite. “Are you sure?” he asked one final time.

Mara didn’t answer. She knew this wouldn’t be a binding. It would be a reckoning.

In the centre of the grove, the trees formed a perfect circle. At its heart, the earth had cracked open — the Wellspring, no longer sealed. It vomited fire and shadows, and from within it rose Thorn.

But he was no longer the boy at the edge of her vision. He was vast now — a shifting mass of limbs and mouths, some screaming, some silent. Faces flickered across his body — men, women, children — twisted in agony, all speaking at once through him.

“You read the letter,” Thorn said, his voice now layered with dozens of others. “You woke us.”

Mara’s breath caught. “You’re not just him.”

“I am all of them.”

The letter had not just been a curse. It had been a wish.

In her final hours, imprisoned and betrayed, Elira had written not just of truth — but of justice. She had called upon the spirits of those murdered, those silenced by the council. She had wished for them to have their final say.

But she had not foreseen what vengeance would become when left to fester in darkness.

Thorn was their fury, unbound. He was the scream of the drowned, the fire of the burned, the choking gasp of the silenced. He was pain turned to purpose. But he had no eyes.

He could not see.

He could not tell who was guilty.

“I only wanted them to speak,” came Elira’s voice, distant and broken, rising from within him.

“But they screamed,” Mara said, tears slipping down her cheeks.

The Ashthorn Rite required sacrifice. But not voice. Not blood.

It required clarity.

Mara stepped into the circle. Her hands did not shake. She held the letter up, then lowered it slowly. “You were never meant to be blind,” she said. “You were meant to see the truth.”

Thorn’s form wavered. “What are you offering me?”

“My eyes,” she said. “So you can finally see.”

He moved like mist and shadow, drifting forward. There was no reverence in his approach, no gratitude. Only hunger.

“Good,” he said, with a terrible eagerness. “I want to see everything.”

He lunged.

With claws cold as death and shaking with greed, Thorn gripped Mara’s face. His fingers sank into her skull like roots finding soil. Pain lanced through her, raw and immediate, as he tore her eyes from her.

She screamed — a sound Thorn didn’t flinch from.

He took her eyes for himself, greedy and triumphant.

And then he saw.

He saw.

He saw the innocent faces twisted in terror. He saw the blood on hands that never held a weapon. He saw the children, the outcasts, the gentle-hearted — all consumed by his blind wrath. He saw what he had become.

Thorn staggered back.

A wind burst through the grove like a howl.

Thorn reeled, his mass convulsing, faces contorting as sight flooded into him for the first time. He screamed — and it was no longer anger, but sorrow. Deep, guttural, human sorrow.

The trees shook. The pit hissed and cracked.

The letter burned black in Mara’s hand and screamed as it turned to ash.

And Thorn — all of him — began to dissolve, like smoke at sunrise.

“Thank you,” he whispered. “For the eyes.”

And then he was gone.

The grove stilled. The Wellspring closed.

Mara collapsed.

When Rowan found her, she was bloodied, blind, and silent. But alive.

Later, they would say she had survived the curse. But Mara knew better. The curse had never been the letter. It had been the lie.
