The fog didn’t lift that night.
Not outside.
Not in Mara’s dreams.

She drifted into sleep as the clock struck two, the sound echoing like a bell toll across her tiny cottage. The moment her eyes closed, she was somewhere else.

The forest.

But not the forest.
Not the one she knew — this version was wrong. Twisted. Each tree crooked unnaturally, their branches reaching down instead of up. The ground pulsed underfoot, wet and breathing. Her breath clouded in the cold, except… she wasn’t cold. She was burning.

“Mara.”

That voice again. Soft. Curious. Close.

She turned. He stood just beyond the trees — the boy. Thorn. Same pale face. Same empty eyes.

But this time, he smiled.

It was not a child’s smile.

She woke with a start, drenched in sweat. Her blankets were on the floor. Her candle had burned down to a stub. For a moment, she could still smell the forest — damp moss, scorched leaves.

Groaning, she sat up and glanced at the tin box under her bed. It looked… wrong. Lopsided.

She pulled it out slowly. Her stomach dropped.

The lid was open.

The letter was gone.

Before she could panic, there was a knock at the door.

Three sharp raps.

She stared at it. No one knocked in the middle of the night unless someone had died. Or unless they were trying to make you think someone had.

Another knock. Louder this time.

Mara crept toward the door and peered through the peephole.

It was Rowan.

Hair askew. Arms crossed. Face pinched in that “you’re-in-trouble-and-I-hate-this-feeling” way of his.

She opened the door just a crack.

“What?” she hissed.

“You screamed,” he said.

“What? No I didn’t—”
“Yes, you did. Loudly. I live two cottages away, and the birds flew off like the apocalypse just started.”

Mara glanced behind her at the bedroom, then back at Rowan.

“I didn’t mean to. I had a… bad dream.”

His eyes narrowed. “Is that why your light’s been on for hours? And why the chapel basement smells like burnt ink now?”

She stiffened.

“Rowan, what were you doing in the chapel basement?”

He ignored the question. “What did you find?”

She hesitated. For a moment, she thought of lying. Of laughing it off. Of saying she spilled candle wax and then screamed at a spider. But her hands were still shaking, and Rowan already looked concerned in that “I’ve-seen-this-before” kind of way.

So she stepped aside.

He walked in slowly, eyes scanning every corner like he expected ghosts to leap out of the flour jar.

She sat on the edge of the bed, staring down at the empty tin box.

“I found a letter,” she said. “Sealed in black wax. Hidden behind one of the shelves in the basement.”

Rowan didn’t reply, but the way his jaw clenched told her he knew exactly what kind of letter she meant.

“I opened it,” she added.

Still nothing.

“And then I saw him.”

Rowan’s head snapped toward her. “Saw who?”

“The boy. Barefoot. Old-fashioned clothes. Pale.”

Rowan’s mouth tightened. “Thorn.”

Mara blinked. “You know about him?”

“Everyone knows about Thorn. Or they did. Sixty years ago.”

He knelt by the tin box, examined it. Rubbed a bit of ash between his fingers.

“You didn’t just read the letter,” he muttered. “It read you back.”

Mara frowned. “What does that even mean?”

Rowan stood, brushing his hands on his coat. “It means we have a problem. And if Thorn’s awake, the curse isn’t sleeping anymore either.”

He looked at her. For the first time, really looked — not like a nosy neighbour, or an old friend, or even a grump with a tendency to eavesdrop. But like someone who knew things she didn’t. Things she wasn’t sure she wanted to know.

“Pack your things,” he said. “We’re going to see Alder.”

Mara’s heart skipped. “The hedgewitch? She’s a hundred and seven. And blind.”

“She’s also the only person alive who knew Elira Ashthorn,” Rowan replied.
“And if we don’t ask her for help now… we won’t be alive much longer.”
