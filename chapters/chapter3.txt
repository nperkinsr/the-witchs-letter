Mara woke with the lingering taste of ashes in her mouth. The red mark on her shoulder had deepened overnight, now an angry, jagged line that seemed to pulse with a life of its own. She touched it lightly, feeling a tingle in her fingertips as if something inside her were shifting.

The village had become... wrong. The rotting of the land, the whispers in the woods, and the hollow echoes of things unsaid filled the air like a constant buzz. Every moment since the letter had passed felt like walking on the edge of a precipice, knowing something dreadful was looming just beneath the surface.

It was early morning when Rowan arrived at her door, his expression tight, his eyes more hollow than usual. He held a piece of parchment, crumpled at the edges. "You need to see this," he said, his voice low.

Mara took the paper. It was an old record from the chapel, one she had never come across during her search. The ink was faded, but the words were unmistakable:

The Council of Elders has sealed the Wellspring with blood. The curse is bound. Elira's sacrifice ensures it will never return.

A chill swept over her as she read the words. She had always thought the council were just stern bureaucrats, self-important but ultimately harmless. But this—this was fanaticism masked as righteousness.

“They weren’t protecting the village,” Mara whispered. “They were hiding something.”

Rowan nodded grimly. “They were religious zealots, Mara. Convinced they could earn forgiveness — not through repentance, but through blood. They invented a creature, said it lived in the woods. Said it needed sacrifice. Said those who disobeyed or questioned were damned — unless they were purged.”

“They murdered people,” Mara said, the words like gravel in her mouth.

“They murdered dissenters,” Rowan corrected. “Anyone who refused to kneel. Anyone who spoke out against their rituals. They weren’t saving anyone. They were silencing them.”

“And Elira?”

Rowan looked away. “She was seventeen. A healer. A real witch — but a kind one. She tended the sick, helped the crops grow, calmed nightmares. People trusted her more than the council. And that made her dangerous.”

“She spoke out,” Mara said, already knowing.

“She called them liars. Exposed their stories for what they were — fiction. And when others started listening, started questioning, the council panicked. Said they had one final ritual. Said they would destroy the beast once and for all.”

Mara’s stomach churned. “So they made her the final sacrifice.”

“In the weeks before her death, they kept her imprisoned,” Rowan said. “They thought she was broken. But she wasn’t. She was furious. Heartbroken. And before they dragged her to the stake, she wrote the letter — her last spell, her last act of defiance. She hid it where only someone seeking the truth would find it.”

“She cursed them,” Mara murmured.

“She cursed the lie,” Rowan corrected. “And the village built on it.”

They set out for the chapel, fog curling thick around their ankles. Inside, the air was damp and heavy with mildew. At the altar, a cracked stone slab marked the entrance to the Wellspring — a pit of forgotten souls and broken promises.

Mara knelt by the stone, fingertips brushing faded inscriptions. The language was unfamiliar, but the weight of it pressed on her mind like a stone. She could feel the pull of it — hungry, ancient, wrong.

The air changed.

A voice slithered through the chapel, low and hollow.

"You woke me."

The words pressed against her skull like claws. She staggered back, heart pounding.

"You... woke... me."

The chapel doors slammed shut. The stone slab cracked open with a shuddering groan.

From the pit, a shadow rose — tall, long-limbed, oozing with dark energy. Its form shifted, flickered, pulsed with a life that wasn’t life. It was Thorn.

Not the boy. Not anymore.

He turned toward her, his grin too wide, too full of teeth.

“Now... it’s time,” he whispered. “Come home.”

Mara backed away, eyes wide. “Rowan!”

“There’s still a way,” he said, voice trembling. “The Ashthorn Rite. An old ritual. It could bind him. Maybe even end this for good.”

“But?”

“It takes something. From you. From your blood.”

Mara stared at the shadow looming before her.

“You can’t outrun me,” Thorn hissed. “You never could.”

Mara looked at Rowan, her voice like steel. “We end this. Now.”
