To whoever reads this, know the curse was never meant for you...

...but it will not care.

It will feed, regardless of your innocence. It will take root, regardless of your will. And once read, the ink stains more than the page.
You may burn this letter. You may bury it, drown it, seal it with silver and spit — still, it will find you.
I am sorry. I was desperate. I was human.
— Elira Ashthorn

Mara blinked in the darkness, the words etched in her mind as if seared there. The letter had gone cold in her hands, unnaturally so. She fumbled for her matches, the tremble in her fingers betraying the steadiness she’d always prided herself on. One. Two. Three failed strikes — the fourth caught.

As the candle flared back to life, her eyes darted over the letter again. The ink shimmered strangely, like oil on water. It was handwritten, but the script shifted slightly when she wasn’t looking directly at it — as though it resented being seen.

She shouldn’t have opened it.

Mara placed it gently on the desk, suddenly aware of the silence pressing in around her. The basement, once musty and still, now felt occupied. She wasn’t alone — and she hadn’t heard anyone come in.

Footsteps sounded above her. Slow. Barefoot.

She froze.

The floor above the basement groaned under the weight of something light but deliberate. Not the boots of a priest, or the clack of a parishioner’s heels. Something softer. Like skin against old wood.

Mara exhaled through her nose, reaching for the candlestick and holding it like a weapon — which was, frankly, laughable. But it made her feel braver.

The footsteps stopped.

Then a whisper: a single syllable, spoken directly behind her ear.

“Mara.”

She spun, candle thrust forward — but no one was there.

Only shadows. Dust. And the now-open letter, pulsing faintly with a dull, red light beneath the words.

She didn’t remember it glowing before.

She stepped back. Tripped over her satchel. Hit the ground with a wince.

By the time she looked up, the glow was gone. The letter lay quiet once more, like a trap waiting to be reset.

Mara snatched it up, stuffed it into her bag, and bolted up the basement steps two at a time. She didn’t stop to explain herself to Father Aldric, who glanced up from polishing a tarnished candelabrum in the chapel and called after her.

She didn’t stop until she’d locked herself in her cottage, drawn every curtain, and placed the letter in a tin box beneath her bed — which, she was certain, pulsed softly for the rest of the night like a second heartbeat.

And as she lay in bed, eyes wide open, she remembered something the old innkeeper had once muttered over tea:

“Some letters write back, if you listen long enough.”
