To whoever reads this, know the curse was never meant for you...

...but it will not care.

It will feed, regardless of your innocence. It will take root, regardless of your will. And once read, the ink stains more than the page.
You may burn this letter. You may bury it, drown it, seal it with silver and spit — still, it will find you.
I am sorry. I was desperate. I was human.
— Elira Ashthorn

Mara blinked in the darkness, her heart hammering against her ribs like it wanted out. The letter felt cold in her hands — not chilled, but dead. She struck a match. It failed. Again. Again. On the fourth try, a stubborn flame finally licked the wick of her candle to life.

The letter lay open on the desk, its ink gleaming faintly. The handwriting was sharp, curling in places like it was trying to climb off the page. She reached out and touched it. The parchment pulsed beneath her fingers. Once. Twice. Then still.

She took a step back.

The air in the basement had shifted. The smell of dust and mildew was replaced with something sweeter, rotting — like overripe fruit left too long in a sealed jar.

Above her, floorboards creaked.

Footsteps. Bare. Slow.

Mara stilled, every part of her body tensing. She wasn’t supposed to be alone in the chapel. But she was. She had been. Until now.

She clutched the candlestick like a blade. The footsteps stopped.

A whisper came next, cool and too close:
“Mara.”

She spun. No one behind her. Just boxes. Shelves. Her own shaking breath.

Then—movement.

A flicker, across the far end of the room.
She turned her candle. The light bobbed, caught a shape near the shelves.

A boy.

No older than ten. Pale skin that looked like candlewax. Black hair slicked to one side, as if freshly combed. He wore outdated clothes — high-collared, buttoned too tightly — and stood barefoot, his eyes wide and glassy, locked onto hers.

She didn’t scream. Couldn’t.

He didn’t move. Didn’t blink.

The candle flickered.

Then, with a blink of shadow, he was gone.

Mara gasped, spinning in place. “Hello?” she whispered. “Are you...?”

The candle snuffed out.

She stumbled back, breath caught in her throat. Hands shaking, she groped for the wall, the stairs, anything.

The letter glowed faintly behind her — that same oily, iridescent red.

She didn’t look back. She ran.

Up the stairs. Past Father Aldric, who shouted her name in alarm. Through the chapel doors and into the sharp bite of the fog-thick evening.

She didn’t stop running until she reached her cottage.

Inside, she locked the door. Drew every curtain. Stuffed the letter into a rusted tin box beneath her bed and shoved her satchel on top of it like that would make a difference.

It didn’t.

Because as she lay in bed, too wired to sleep, the image of that boy haunted her — silent, watching, waiting.

And in the moment before she finally drifted off, she heard it again — soft, not quite a whisper, not quite a breath:

“Mara.”
