It began with rot.

First the milk — fresh in the morning, sour before noon. Then the bread. Then the bellflowers in the churchyard, curling into themselves like burnt paper. Mara heard whispers about a child screaming at her own reflection. About the butcher's dog that now barked at walls. About the chapel bell ringing at midnight, though no one had pulled the rope.

The curse was spreading.

Mara had stayed silent. Told no one about the letter. Not even Rowan, who had been her friend since they were children sneaking honey cakes from the village pantry. But after the dream, after the mark bloomed dark and sharp across her shoulder like a bruise in the shape of a sentence, she knew she couldn’t face it alone.

She sought out Alder.

The hedgewitch lived on the edge of the woods in a lopsided cottage that smelled of ash and iron. Alder was blind, with eyes like clouded glass marbles, but she saw more than most. When Mara handed her the letter — sealed again somehow, its wax cool and black and pulsing faintly — Alder didn’t touch it. She smelled it.

And recoiled.

“You should be dead already,” Alder rasped. "You opened it. Fool child."

Mara swallowed. “Can it be undone?”

“Undone?” Alder laughed, dry as fallen leaves. “You think it’s a knot to untie? This is bloodcraft. Soulwork. The thing bound by that letter isn’t a ghost — it’s hungry.”

It had a name, once. Elira. A girl who’d lived in Blackwood Hollow long ago, and died badly.

Alder told the story like it was bone memory. Elira had struck a blood pact to trap something ancient in the woods — something that fed on stories, on voices, on memory. Her body was the seal. Her death the binding. But blood calls to blood.

And Mara had woken it up.

The village began to turn.

People spoke less. Shadows grew longer. Mirrors began to warp — not visibly, not enough to notice at first, but enough that reflections lagged half a second behind. Enough that people stopped looking.

Mara confided in Rowan. He didn’t laugh. He didn’t run. He said, “Then let’s find out who Elira really was.”

They searched the chapel records, and when that turned up nothing but pages that smelled too strongly of smoke, they broke into the locked archives beneath the sacristy. There, they found it — an old trial document, warped with water and something else. Elira had been accused of witchcraft. She was seventeen. She didn’t scream when they burned her.

Her last words were scratched into the page: I will be the story they cannot silence.

Mara and Rowan went to the grove where it had happened — the place from her dream. The trees stood too tall. The red thread hung loose now, fluttering like ribbons. And the birds — so many birds — perched upside-down, heads turned toward the earth, their eyes sewn shut.

Mara’s mouth tasted of ash.

Thorn was waiting.

He appeared between the trees like smoke between ribs. Not fully seen, only guessed — a silhouette with too many joints. He hummed the lullaby again, slower this time, dragging the notes like claws.

"Why me?" Mara whispered.

Thorn tilted his head. "Because you read me. Like a story."

He reached for her hand, and in the touch came a vision — Elira crawling out of the dirt, her body charred and eyeless, lips moving silently as if still reciting the words that had cursed her.

Mara screamed and fell backward into Rowan, who caught her just as the vision shattered.

When she woke, she was outside her cottage.

Barefoot. Freezing.

With blood on her palms.

The letter waited on her doorstep, perfectly sealed.
