Elira Ashthorn (The Witch)
Role: Central figure; wrote the cursed letter decades ago.

Body: Tall, thin, with tangled silver hair and deep-set violet eyes. Skin like aged parchment, covered in ink-stained sigils.

Personality: Brooding, intelligent, cryptic. Torn between vengeance and remorse. Thinks in riddles.

2. Mara Whitlow (Protagonist / Village Scribe)
Role: Discovers the letter while cataloguing old archives.

Body: Petite, freckled, short auburn hair always tied up with a quill stuck in it. Wears dusty spectacles.

Personality: Inquisitive, stubborn, too clever for her own good. Trusts logic over superstition — until the letter speaks to her.

3. Father Aldric (Village Priest)
Role: Warns Mara against the letter; knows more than he admits.

Body: Stocky, grizzled beard, sharp green eyes that rarely blink.

Personality: Stern but not cruel. Faithful, deeply conflicted, hiding his past involvement with the witch.

4. Rowan Greaves (Mara’s Childhood Friend)
Role: Helps Mara investigate; secretly in love with her.

Body: Broad-shouldered, calloused hands, sandy-blond hair. Always smells like cedar and ink.

Personality: Loyal, cautious, level-headed. The grounded one — until he starts dreaming of Elira.

5. Cassia Hollow (Healer / Apathetic Mystic)
Role: Descendant of the witch; holds the key to reversing the curse.

Body: Ethereal beauty, black curls down to her hips, golden-brown skin and one white eye.

Personality: Mysterious, dry-humoured, never gives a straight answer. Probably high on herbs.

6. Mayor Dunwick (Corrupt Authority Figure)
Role: His ancestor betrayed Elira. He wants to keep history buried.

Body: Tall, imposing, polished boots and too many rings.

Personality: Charismatic in public, ruthless in private. Manipulative. Will burn the archives before the truth gets out.

7. Nellie Crumb (Gossip / Innkeeper)
Role: Spreads secrets faster than disease. Accidentally helpful.

Body: Round, jolly-looking with a mop of curly grey hair. Constantly flour-dusted.

Personality: Nosy, talkative, actually smarter than people think. Knows everyone’s dirt.

8. Thorn (Silent Boy / Ghost?)
Role: Appears to Mara after she opens the letter. Connected to Elira.

Body: Thin, barefoot, eyes too old for his face. Wears clothes from a forgotten era.

Personality: Doesn’t speak, only stares. Guides Mara silently. Possibly a memory or a cursed soul.

9. Elias Mourn (Scholar from the Capital)
Role: Arrives to study the letter. Obsessed with forbidden magic.

Body: Gaunt, long fingers, constantly writing in a leather journal. Raven-black ponytail and pale eyes.

Personality: Arrogant, intense, brilliant. You want to hate him but need him too.

10. Nyx (The Familiar)
Role: Elira’s magical raven-cat hybrid. Only appears at night.

Body: Cat-sized, black feathers instead of fur, glowing amber eyes, forked tail.

Personality: Snarky, wisecracking, chaotic neutral. Loves sardines and secrets. Appears with a "tsk" whenever Mara messes up.
